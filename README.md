This assignment from [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/testing-your-ruby-code#project-tdd-connect-four) recreates the classic Connect Four game with RSpec unit tests.

In Connect Four, players take turns placing their game pieces in a grid. The first player to reach four consecutive game pieces in any direction (horizontal, vertical or diagonal) wins the game.
